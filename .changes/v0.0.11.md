## 0.0.11
+ `--started` and `--version` no longer silently include nodes, which did not have this info supplied by CMS at all (due to old YDB version). 
  Now `ydbops` explicitly refuses to add any nodes with empty start time or empty version and produces a warning.

## 0.0.10
+ `version` command
+ new release pipeline - modify CHANGELOG.md only, rest is automatic

## 0.0.9
+ Information about version in help output
+ Scripts for build release
